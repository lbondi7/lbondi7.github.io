## What I Learned

I consolidated my understanding of Clion as well as c++. I learned about component based programming and incorporated that into the game. I also learned how useful a level buidler is when creating levels. It m=ade it much easier to create teh levels as we didnt need to keep chaning little values bit by bit to get the level we wanted, we could just drag and drop it in. I also learned about how the components should talk to one another through discussing it with my lecturer.
