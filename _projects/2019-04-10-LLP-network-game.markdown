## Features

The game is a 2-4 player network game, where players have to move around the board and collect food tokens in order to get score. The first to 200 points wins or when the deck of cards is used. The board is constantly changing with the players having to avoid deforested areas in order to keep the lives and score. The game also ends when the entire board is deforested.
