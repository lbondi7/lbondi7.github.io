# Breakout

---

## Original

The original breakout game I made was done for my ESD module back in Feb 2018. It was a quite a mess of a code base and also was done all in one class which is never good. I remember it being entertaining to do at the time and also struggling with some stuff like collision and spawning in the blocks.

## What I learned

Even though I struggled with breakout I did learn about/consilidate my knkowledge on:
  - Collsion
  - Vectors
  - Arrays
  - Bounding Boxes
  - Gameplay

## Remake

After seeings ome of the first years breakout I decided to revemp my old one to make it more fun. I have incorporated some of the techniques and skills, I picked up since I last did breakout:
  - Scene Manager
  - Pause State
  - Leaderboard
  - Power Ups
