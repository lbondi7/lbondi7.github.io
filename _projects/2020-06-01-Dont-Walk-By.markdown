The aim of the game is too get through each level without losing any students to accidents or other hazards. The levels get progressively harder but the player is given abilities to help navigate or neutralise the hazards. Based on how many students were saved, time taken and number of abilities used at the end the player will get a grading  out of 3 stars. There is also a map editor so players can build and save their own custom levels as well.

Abilities
- Tarffic Warden: Directs students in a direction chosen by the player.
- Medic: Heals any injured students in close proximinty.
- Fireman: Is called in to deal with any hazards that are in the way.
- DJ: Used to distract and contain the students so they can't get injured by any hazards.

This was a game developed by the UWE cohort in my year (50+ people), where we had our own groups and were assigned part of the game to focus on as a group and then specfic machanics or features of that part. Our group role was the producer/director/cohort management/miscellaneous tasks. My specific role was implementing the camera, allowing the player to zoom in and out, it be confind to the bounds of the map and allow the players to track individual lemmings by clicking on them. Helping to design/refine areas of gameplay such as abilities and ai behaivour. I also helped my team in managing the other teams and dealing with any issues or friction that arrose between other teams.
