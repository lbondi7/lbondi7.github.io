#### Awesome Sauce Game Engine
Developed in response to students needs, a small framework built upon modern C++ was created modelled in the XNA mould. It is designed to afford accessible game development, but restrict the level of hand-holding required. At current, it supports only 2D and does not provide advanced technologies such as networking or controller input. 

#### Foundations
ASGE is built upon the following technologies
1. C++11
2. GLEW
3. GLFW
4. GLM
5. STB
6. PDCurses
