## Breakout
**Breakout** is a game I designed whilst in my first year at U.W.E. It was coded using c++ and in the ASGE. It plays very similar to the original, except with a different graphical layout and some modifications.

The image above shows the breakout whilst in game. The ball is about to hit the paddle and the diamonds are falling down. If the diamonds are caught, they give the player extra points.

**This game was made for educatonal purposes, for me show my improvement as a games developer and so this was not made for any commercial purposes.**
