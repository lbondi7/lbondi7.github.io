## Particle System Deisgner

---

## Features

This is a particle system deisgner that is made in ASGE. It allows a user to create and manipulate particles to deisgn a particle system to produce an effect such as rain, fire, snow etc. The user clicks on whether they want to edit teh particles or the emitter. Once the user is happy with the particle effect, they then can give it a filename and save it. It saves all the information into a txt file which then is used to read teh data back in.
