## Features

It is set on a abandoned ship which the player has to escape. It has multiple endings where teh player can die, can escape into space and can escape to a planet. Each ending gives a different score multiplier which is applied when the game ends. To escape the player has to pick up items which adds to their score but also allows them to explore the ship as some areas are restricted till the player has an item.

## What I Learned

I learned how to use a new IDE called Clion which is industry standard and also allows me to make games cross platform a lot easier. It consolidated my understanding of pointers which improved my understanding and usage of memory management.
