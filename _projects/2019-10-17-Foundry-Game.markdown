In CGD we have to do 3 game jams to bond as team. The second game jam had to be a game based around the foundry (a place in the unviersity where the univeristy's game studio is based). 

The aim of the game is run a game studio (a stripped back version) succesfully. The player has to control workers in the studio to go and collect tasks and complete them within a time limit. You click and drag the worker over to task area, click accept then click and drag the worker over to a work station to work on the task. Once the task is done the player clicks and drags the wroker over to the publish room to gain score.

Other challenges in the game were events to inconvience the player. An example of this a task might require a blue haired worker to complete it or multiple workers or a specific item. This doesn't stop the player but means they have to be aware of the issue and try and sort it out. This si all happening whilst more requests are coming through. Another challenge is the rating system for the tasks. A task can either be 1, 2 or 3 stars. These respresnt difficulty and will take longer to complete but the player will earn more money on completing a task. There is also a star rating of the players performance based on how many tasks were completed.

My role for this game jam was audio programmer. What I did was store a list of the sound effects we had in the game in an audio manager (singleton) and grouped them based on what they were used for. These were split into task, misc and looped. Then there were various function calls that could be made to adjust volume (globally adn individually), play, stop, and pause.

### Objectives

- Accept a task
- Complete task
- Gain score
- Repeat
- Try and get 3 stars
