## VR Deforestation

---

## Features

- VR
- Oculus Quest
- C#
- Unity
- Low Poly

The goal of the project was to produce an experience in VR. We decided on an educational experience on the topic of deforestation as it is very relevant today. The project used audio and visuals to inform the user and it was meant to be used by people of all ages o we decided against incorporating hand controls. We didn't want people to be distracted by not knowing how to use the controls.

It starts off showing the earth as dying planet as the player zooms in then fades to a scene in a "amazon rainforest" and a voice over provides information about the amazon and how it helps earth. It transitions to a scene a scene where the player is burning down the forest based on where they look whilst the voice over starts talking about the damage that is done to amazon every year. It then talks about how the user can help prevent more destruction before fading out then zooming out the earth as it turns from a murky brown to a vibrant green.

My primary job was lead programmer but I also did some work on the level design. I programmed in the fire and it sparking from where the player looks and it spreading from the ground to trees and vice versa, including the withering and fading of the trees. This was reason for it being low poly, as we know we wanted a lot of particles for the fire and if the assets were realistic then the Oculus wouldn't of been able to handle that many high quality textures with the number of objects.

**This game was made for educational purposes, for me show my improvement as a games developer and so this was not made for any commercial purposes.**
