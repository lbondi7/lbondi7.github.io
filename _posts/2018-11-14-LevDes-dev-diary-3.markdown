# Level Design

## Plan

The plan for my level is to make it 3 stages. The town, the cave and the weird location. The player will work their way through all three areas then once they have been woken up the big creature, they will have to run back trhough all three except they have changed slightly.

### The Town

The images below are initial drawings of how the town will look and feel. It will only have a couple of buildings with a rundown playground. The size of the environment is due to the time constraints of the assessment and the fact it is only meant to have a few minutes of gameplay. All the houses will be able to be explored with the one being the house with the upgrade. The whole town will have an eerie feel and look abandoned with only a couple of people who seem like they are insane and talking gibberish.
