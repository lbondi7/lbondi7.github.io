C++ offers several simple and easy ways to loop. Loops can be used to process the same logic a number of times. The most common is the for loop, followed by while and the do-while. These loops are known as conditional because they continue to loop until a specific condition is met. <!--more-->

## The For Loop
-----

The for loop is simply defined using:
1. An initial value
2. A condition to check the value against after every iteration
3. An operation to perform after every iteration

```
for( int i=0; i<10; ++i )
{
  // Logic goes here...
}
```

As you can see it's basic usage is simple and easy to reason.
