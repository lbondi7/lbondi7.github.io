# Level Design

## Assessment

### Overview
I have been tasked to make a level for a assessment for the Game level Design module. The level must use the unreal 3rd person template with the project inspired by Lovecraft, Cthulu, The Wicker Man among others.

### Level Structure
The level is based on a island where you are a mainland police officer investigating suspicious reports. The island is damp and dull with an eerie feeling about it.

The level starts with the player traveling to the island by boat. There is a building that you need to find information about from characters and/or the environment/objects. The player enters the house by overcoming a challenge, the player then gets some ort of upgrade from inside the house. The player then has to find a hidden entrance to a cave below the house. Explore the have to discover artifacts of some sort that allow the player to transport to mysterious place. This locaton has weird and unusual physics. The player has to explore but in doing so finds a creature that then chases the player back to the level, but on the way the player has use all of the upgrades they have aquired.

#### Upgrades
The player should be able to walk, run, jump, fall and interact with things right from the start but then gain the ability to long jump/wall run, destroy objects, knock back objects/enemies, pull objects/enemies towards them. Must use all these abilities to complete the level.

#### Environment
The environment should fit with the theme and the town should be built out of parts so the houses aren't just models but can be entered and ineracted with. Make the enviroment interesting as the theme is weird fiction.

#### Challenges
The player should have challenges to overcome such as obstcales or enemies but think about why the enemies are attacking the player. How will the creature that player runs into effect the environment and how will that effect the player and gameplay.

#### Progression
The game should keep the player interested and want to play but also how will the level allow the player to progress and then retreat at the end but not before then.
