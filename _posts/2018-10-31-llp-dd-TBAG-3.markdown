This will be the second update on the text based adventure game I am working on. 

## Storing Room Data

I am reading in the room information from a txt file. I have set up a the txt file to contain the information about the room in the format as follows:
~~~
Description                                         Example
{                                                   {
-The name of the room                               name:OPERATIONS ROOM
-The room id number                                 roomID:11
-If it has a an item                                has item:1
-The name of the item                               item:BANANA
-If the room is safe                                safe:0
-The warning message of the room                    safety message:IT'S DANGEROUS IN THERE
-If the room needs an item to access it             accessible:1
-Item required for access                           item/action required:-
-The requirement message of the room                accesibility message:-
}                                                   }
[                                                   [
-If he player can exit north                        north:27
-If he player can exit east                         east:-1
-If he player can exit south                        south:-1
-If he player can exit west                         west:4
]                                                   ]
~~~

All this information from each txt file will be stored into a 2 dimensional vector in the room class which stores all the data read in from a file.

With 'has item', 'safe' and 'accessible' all bools so when read in from a file they have to be 1 or 0 so they can be converted into true or false.

With 'north', 'south', 'east' and west' if the number next to it is -1 then it means the user can head in that direction from that room and and if it is greater than 0 then then the player can head in that direction and it updates the current room using the number. What it will do is go to element in the vector and change all the variables of that room to the data at that point in the vector. This is shown in th code below. I am setting the room name to equal the data that point in the vector.

## Setting Room Variables
In the code snippet below, 'value' is the variable that is passed in when the room is updated and it goes to that element of the of vector and the 0 represents the first element of the vector at the point value.
~~~
room_name = name_of_vector[value].at(0);
~~~
In my room class a I have variables which will contain infromation about the room. After the data has been read in all these variables are set to whatever data has been read in.
~~~
    std::string room_name = " ";
    int room_id = 0;
    bool has_item = false;
    std::string item_name = " ";
    bool safe = true;
    std::string message = " ";
    bool access = false;
    std::string item_required = " ";
    std::string requirement_message = " ";
    int dir[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};
~~~
I've decide to use vectors as it allows me to create more txt files and add to the txt and means less editting in my cpp files.
