This will be a first update on the text based adventure game I am working on. 

## Update

The BASIC version of the game has a few bugs or bad gameplay choices. These include not being able to erase an input after it has been typed, when you are in the room with the scroll bats attack you and you need the aerosol can to escape. If the you keep inputting "W" then after 2 or 3 times it will allow to escape that room. Some bad gameplay choices are that when the player goes to the marsh you get stuck and can't move unless you have the so the player has to restart the game. This is also the same with getting the painting. If the player goes there before getting the scroll then the player can't get out because they don't know the magic word.

The image above shows the layout for my abandoned ship. The idea is there are certain areas that require certain items to get namely "Space" as the player will require a spacesuit in order to gain access to this room. The list below are all the items that are going to be available.

~~~
Items
• Map (Operations Room)
• Empty Gun (Armoury)
• Bullets (Ammunition Room)
• Crowbar (Loading Bay)
• Knife (Kitchen)
• Banana (Canteen)
• Key (Swimming Pool)
