**Spoiler warning!** The film is about a millionaire who invents an AI and then invites one of his employees to take a turing test on the AI to see if it can pass as a human. Some themes in the film were isolation, evolution, mainpulation and playing god. So the game idea we decided on was a physics platformer based on the themes being a god and manipulation.
