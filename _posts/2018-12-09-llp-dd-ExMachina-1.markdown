Form a group of 4 and come up with a game idea based on the film Ex-Machina. Produce a GDD and a TDD, the game, worklogs and a trailer for the game. 

**Spoiler warning!** The film is about a millionaire who invents an AI and then invites one of his employees to take a turing test on the AI to see if it can pass as a human. Some themes in the film were isolation, evolution, mainpulation and playing god.
