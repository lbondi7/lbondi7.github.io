## Burning Everything

Similar to to last week's blog, I managed to get the fire burning effect implemented with the terrain being burned after it has finished.

A particle effect has been added to start when the player is looking at something that isn't burned and can be burned. This is to help people know where they are looking.

Next task is to have the fire spread from mesh to mesh, to give a nice spread effect.
