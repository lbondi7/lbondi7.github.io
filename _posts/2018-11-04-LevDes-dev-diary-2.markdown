## Ideas

I was reading over the stories and ideas that the project is inspired by. All of them have a mysterious element of suspense and susprise, that is almost supernatural and creepy or scary. 

For my level I was making the I thinking of making the island have heavy fog cover the whole island so the player has a sense of uncertainty all the time with it being set during the night to add even more unease. The boat the player arrives on is pretty small with it being controlled by a mysterious guy who warns the about the island and the people who live there. The island will be very rocky, with the town far above sea level as it is a island off Scotland.

The images below are initial drawings of how the town will look and feel. It will only have a couple of buildings with a rundown playground. The size of the environment is due to the time constraints of the assessment and the fact it is only meant to have a few minutes of gameplay. All the houses will be able to be explored with the one being the house with the upgrade. The whole town will have an eerie feel and look abandoned with only a couple of people who seem like they are insane and talking gibberish.
