## Map Movement

To allow the player to llok around the map I put in clicking and dragging the map. The meant that the map didn't have to fit on the screen anymore as the player could just drag it around and place the map however he wants it. I also added in a zooming in and out feature to so the player could zoom in on a tile or zoom out to see the entire map to check where the other players are. Plus its just a cool feature to have in the game.
