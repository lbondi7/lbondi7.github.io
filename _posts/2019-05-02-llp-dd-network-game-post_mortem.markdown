## Pros
<ul>
    <li>It works very well and is easier to pick up and understand.</li>
    <li>The UI deisgn is nice and with animations it makes it feel really nice to navigate around.</li>
    <li>Transfering it over from the board game to a digital version was challenging but enjoyable (sometimes).</li>
    <li>The board game was well made so none of the features have been chopped.</li>
</ul>

## Cons
<ul>
    <li>Lack of animations in game scene.</li>
    <li>The code base is a mess as nearly all of it was done by me.</li>
    <li>team mates that didn't do any work, made it difficult to get done so it was stressful hitting the dealines</li>
    <li>The server side of the code is messy and would be improved next time with more refactroing and input from other people.</li>
    <li>The lack of audio is very apaprent takes some shine off the game.</li>
</ul>

## Potential Improvements
<ul>
    <li>Add animations in game scene.</li>
    <li>Refactor code more so it is cleaner.</li>
    <li>Add audio to go along with the game to make it more immersive.</li>
</ul>

## What I Learned
<ul>
    <li>I learned about networking in the game as well as how to send data between clients and a server and syncig them up.</li>
    <li>It reinforced my understanding of c++ as well as improving my c++ skills.</li>
    <li>Also I learned to appreciate having team members who are able to be given a task and get on with it, like it was for my Ex-Machina group and is for GEP group.</li>
</ul>
